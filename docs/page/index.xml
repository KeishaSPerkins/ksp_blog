      <description>Keisha&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;Perkins is a self-taught designer and developer from Baton&amp;nbsp;Rouge, Louisiana. She works for the library by day and codes by night.
She was attracted to the front-end because of its melding of problem solving and visual design, as well as its never-ending list of things to learn.
Keisha is driven by an eagerness to create, a desire to learn, and a need to teach. Her passions have contributed to her creating curriculum for teaching the youth in her area, of which she is very proud.</description>
