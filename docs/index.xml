      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that all of us have at one time or another needed to get a job done on a small&amp;ndash;or sometimes non-existent&amp;ndash;budget. At times like these, we scour the web for quality free and cheap design assets. This post will share my favorite sources for free assets. They&amp;rsquo;re in no particular order, but I think they&amp;rsquo;re all pretty cool.
Pexels: Free Stock Photos and Video  Pexels  Though the free stock images are what brought me to Pexels in the first place, you can also find quality stock videos there.</description>

      <description>Hello, and welcome to my new blog! I decided that I wanted a blog, and so here it is. This will predominantly be a design and web development blog. I love to teach, and I like to write. So, I figured there&amp;rsquo;d be no better place to write the things I want to teach!</description>

      <description>Keisha&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;Perkins is a self-taught designer and developer from Baton&amp;nbsp;Rouge, Louisiana. She works for the library by day and codes by night.
She was attracted to the front-end because of its melding of problem solving and visual design, as well as its never-ending list of things to learn.
Keisha is driven by a eagerness to create, a desire to learn, and need to teach. Her passions have contributed to her creating curriculum for teaching the youth in her area, of which she is very proud.</description>
