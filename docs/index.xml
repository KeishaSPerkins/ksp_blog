      <description>I create a good deal of media for my church, and sometimes that media needs to be used in many ways. Perhaps the event flier that I create for a pre-service loop of slides needs to also be made to fit social media, or be printed and handed out.
Up until recently I solved this issue by first designing something for the church&amp;rsquo;s presentation screen at a 16:9 ratio, then resizing and tweaking the design to meet whatever other needs where given to me.</description>

      <description>When I began to foray into Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Creative Suite, I was using Photoshop for everything. Need a logo for lots of uses? Just deliver a huge PNG! Want to draw a nice crisp illustration? Photoshop&amp;rsquo;s pen tool works just fine for that, right?
Photoshop was my one-stop for everything I needed, though none of what I needed was what Photoshop was created for. It was some time before I even considered using any of Adobe&amp;rsquo;s many great pieces of software that actually suited my needs, like Illustrator.</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that all of us have at one time or another needed to get a job done on a small&amp;ndash;or sometimes non-existent&amp;ndash;budget. At times like these, we scour the web for quality free and cheap design assets. This post will share my favorite sources for free assets. They&amp;rsquo;re in no particular order, but I think they&amp;rsquo;re all pretty cool.
Pexels: Free Stock Photos and Video  Pexels  Though the free stock images are what brought me to Pexels in the first place, you can also find quality stock videos there.</description>

      <description>Hello, and welcome to my new blog! I decided that I wanted a blog, and so here it is. This will predominantly be a design and web development blog. I love to teach, and I like to write. So, I figured there&amp;rsquo;d be no better place to write the things I want to teach!</description>

      <description>This talk is about using JavaScript to create games on the HTML5 canvas. Though you won’t create the next Halo, you’ll learn so much about JavaScript and programming as a whole when you create games with it. In this talk, I’ll introduce you to a library that’s perfect for beginners and “non-coders” alike called p5.js.
Why JavaScript? JavaScript is everywhere. If you use the internet, you’ve almost certainly encountered JavaScript.</description>
